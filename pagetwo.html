    <p>I will become a web developer
        I am currently learning to code from scratch with the help of The Odin Project and some Youtube videos. I don't have few knowledge in coding prior to taking TOP.
        
        I did not copy the Lorem Ipsum coz it's too boring. This is just a sample paragraph so that I can see the changes I am making.
        
        The texts on this sentence should be ITALIC. You do it by simply inserting an em tag. The em tag stand for emphasis.
        
        The texts on this sentence should be BOLD. In this one, you do it by using the strong tag.
        
        You may also use both em and strong tags together to make bold italic texts. To do that, just put both tags inside your paragraph.
        
        Inserting links
        To insert links into your paragraph. You will have to use an anchor tag And that anchor tag is href.
        
        This a link to my Facebook. Clicking it will redirect you to my facebook profile.
